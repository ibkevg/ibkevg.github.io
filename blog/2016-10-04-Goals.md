# High Level Goals

* How does General Relativity, Einstein's gravitational field equations, give rise to Newton's gravitational law?
* If General Relativity warps space-time, does that mean the objects in the space-time are similarly warped?
  * Similarly if the universe is expanding, are the objects in the universe also expanding?
* Does time stop passing for objects travelling at the speed of light? (e.g. light itself)
* How does Special Relativity give rise to a Block Universe (the idea that space-time embodies past/present/future)?
* How can Special Relativity explain why electric charge gives rise to magnetism and vice versa?
* Why is the principle of Stationary Action so important in physics?
* Why is Noether's Theorem so important? What does it mean to say that "a one-parameter variational symmetry group gives rise to a conservation law of the Euler-Lagrange equations"

# Plans

"A goal without a plan is just a wish."
